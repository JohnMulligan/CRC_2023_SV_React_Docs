# fetchSearchGlobalApi

## Description
`fetchSearchGlobalApi` is a JavaScript function for making an asynchronous HTTP POST request to a backend API using Axios. It is intended for searching global data via the API. This function can be used in various contexts within your application where global search functionality is required.

## Installation
Before using this code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed in your project:

- Axios: Axios is used for making HTTP requests and is required for sending the request to the backend API.
You can install Axios using npm or yarn:
```jsx
npm install axios
```

## Usage
1) Import the necessary dependencies and constants at the top of your JavaScript file:

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';
import { AUTHTOKEN, BASEURL } from '../../share/AUTH_BASEURL';
```
1) Use the fetchSearchGlobalApi function to make an asynchronous HTTP POST request to the backend API:

```jsx
const formData = new FormData();
// Add any form data parameters needed for the search.

const signal = new AbortController().signal;

try {
    const searchData = await fetchSearchGlobalApi(formData, signal);
    // Handle the searchData response here.
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message); // Handle the error appropriately.
}

```

1) Ensure that you provide the necessary form data parameters required for the global search in the `FormData` object. You can customize the `formData` object to match the API's requirements.

1) Make sure that `AUTHTOKEN` and `BASEURL` are correctly configured with your API's authentication token and base URL.

## Error Handling
The `fetchSearchGlobalApi` function handles errors by throwing an error with the message 'Failed to fetch `fetchSearchGlobalApi` data' if the request to the backend API fails. You can catch this error and handle it appropriately in your application.

## Signal (AbortController)
This function accepts an optional `signal` parameter, which allows you to pass an `AbortSignal` to the Axios request. This can be useful for canceling the request if needed, such as when a user cancels a search operation.
