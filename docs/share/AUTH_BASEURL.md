# Environment Variables Documentation

## Overview
The provided code defines environment variables used in a JavaScript or TypeScript application. These environment variables are typically configured at build time and are used to customize the behavior of the application based on the deployment environment.

## Environment Variables
The code defines the following environment variables:

### BASEURL
- Type: String
- Purpose: This variable likely represents the base URL for making API requests in the application. It specifies the server or service that the application communicates with.
### AUTHTOKEN
- Type: String
- Purpose: This variable likely represents an authentication token or API key required for accessing protected resources or authenticating with an API. It is used for securing API requests.
### HOST
- Type: String
- Purpose: This variable likely represents the host or domain of the application. It specifies the server or location where the application is hosted. It can be useful for generating absolute URLs or handling routing.
### POST
- Type: Unknown (Typo?)
- Purpose: This variable is named `POST`, but its purpose is unclear based on the provided code. It may be intended for some specific configuration related to network requests, but the variable name might be a typo.
## Usage
Environment variables are typically used throughout the application to customize behavior based on the deployment environment. They can be accessed using `import.meta.env` in JavaScript or TypeScript modules.

## Example Usage
```jsx
import { BASEURL, AUTHTOKEN, HOST } from './environment';

// Using environment variables
console.log(`Base URL: ${BASEURL}`);
console.log(`Auth Token: ${AUTHTOKEN}`);
console.log(`Host: ${HOST}`);
```

## Configuration
Environment variables are usually set during the build process or configured in a `.env` file specific to the deployment environment. The exact configuration may vary depending on the build tool or framework used for the application.

## Security Considerations
- `Security of Sensitive Information:` Ensure that sensitive information, such as authentication tokens or API keys, is kept secure and not exposed in client-side code or public repositories.
- `Environment-Specific Values:` Use environment variables to store values that can change between different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Avoid hardcoding such values.
