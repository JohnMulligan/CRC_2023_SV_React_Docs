# Documentation for extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles and extractVarNames Functions

This documentation describes two functions, `extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles` and `extractVarNames`, used to extract variable names from a menu structure. These functions are designed to work with data related to past enslaved individuals and utilize asynchronous operations for data fetching.

## `extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles` Function
## Overview
The `extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles` function recursively extracts variable names from a hierarchical menu structure. It searches through the menu items and their children, collecting variable names encountered along the way.

## Usage
```jsx
/**
 * Recursively extract variable names from a hierarchical menu structure.
 *
 * @param {any[]} menu - The menu structure to extract variable names from.
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} - A Promise that resolves to an array of variable names.
 */
export const extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles = async (menu: any[]): Promise<string[]> => {
    // Implementation details...
};
```

## Parameters
- `menu (required):` An array of menu items, where each item may have a `var_name` property or children.

## Return Value
- A Promise that resolves to an array of variable names (strings) extracted from the menu structure.

## `extractVarNames` Function
Overview
The extractVarNames function is responsible for fetching data related to past enslaved individuals. It uses an asynchronous operation to fetch the data from the fetchPastEnslavedApiService function.

## Usage

```jsx
/**
 * Fetch data related to past enslaved individuals and return it.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A Promise that resolves when the data is fetched.
 */
export const extractVarNames = async (): Promise<void> => {
    // Implementation details...
};
```
## Return Value
- A Promise that resolves when the data related to past enslaved individuals is fetched. The data itself is not returned directly from this function.

## Example
```jsx
// Example usage of extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles and extractVarNames functions
const menuStructure = [
    { var_name: "variable1" },
    {
        var_name: "variable2",
        children: [
            { var_name: "variable3" },
            { var_name: "variable4" },
        ],
    },
    { var_name: "variable5" },
];

async function main() {
    const variableNames = await extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles(menuStructure);
    console.log(variableNames);
    
    await extractVarNames();
}

main();
```

In this example, the `extractTestVarNamesFlatFiles` function is used to extract variable names from the menuStructure array, which contains a hierarchical menu of variables. The `extractVarNames` function is also invoked to fetch data related to past enslaved individuals asynchronously. The extracted variable names are then logged to the console.
