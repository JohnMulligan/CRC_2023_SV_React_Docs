# getFilterSlice
This code defines a Redux slice for managing a filter state. The slice is created using the `createSlice` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.

## Usage
To use this Redux slice, follow these steps:

1) Install the required dependencies by running npm install @reduxjs/toolkit.

2) Import the necessary modules:
```jsx
import { PayloadAction, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

```
3) Create the Redux slice using the createSlice function:
```jsx
export const getFilterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'getFilter',
    initialState: {
        isFilter: false
    },
    reducers: {
        setIsFilter: (state, action: PayloadAction<boolean>) => {
            state.isFilter = action.payload;
        },
    },
});

```
4) Export the action creator and reducer from the slice:

```jsx
export const { setIsFilter } = getFilterSlice.actions;
export default getFilterSlice.reducer;
```
## State Structure
The state structure of the filter slice is as follows:
```jsx
{
    isFilter: false
}

```
- `isFilter`: A boolean value representing the filter state. It is initially set to false.

## Actions
This Redux slice defines a single action:

- `setIsFilter`: Sets the filter state to the value provided in the payload. The payload should be a boolean value indicating whether the filter is active or not.

## Reducer
The reducer function in this slice updates the state with the payload received from the `setIsFilter` action.

## Example Usage
To use this Redux slice in your application, you can dispatch the `setIsFilter` action with the desired filter state payload:

```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { setIsFilter } from './path/to/getFilterSlice';

// Inside a component or action creator
const dispatch = useDispatch();

const isFilterActive = true; // Set the desired filter state

dispatch(setIsFilter(isFilterActive));

```
This will update the state with the new filter state and trigger any relevant Redux state updates or subscriptions.

Note: Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.
