# getScrollPageSlice
The getScrollPageSlice slice in the Redux store manages the state related to scrolling functionality in the application.

### Slice Configuration
The getScrollPageSlice is configured using the createSlice function from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It defines the following properties:

```getScrollPageSlice```: The getScrollPageSlice is configured using the createSlice function from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It defines the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the slice is set to "getScrollPage".
- `initialState`: The initial state of the slice includes two properties:
    - `currentPage`: Represents the current page number and is initially set to 1.
    - `isOpenDialog`: A boolean flag indicating whether a dialog or modal is open, initially set to false.

`Actions`
The getScrollPageSlice slice defines the following actions:

- `setCurrentPage`: Accepts a payload of type number and updates the currentPage property in the state with the provided value.
- `setIsOpenDialog`: Accepts a payload of type boolean and updates the isOpenDialog property in the state with the provided value.

To use these actions, import them from `getScrollPageSlice` and dispatch them as needed to modify the state.

``Reducer``

The reducer function for getScrollPageSlice is automatically generated by the createSlice function. It handles state updates based on the dispatched actions and returns the updated state.

## Usage
To use the getScrollPageSlice in other parts of the application, follow these steps:

1) Import the necessary actions and the reducer function from getScrollPageSlice.
2) Dispatch the actions (setCurrentPage, setIsOpenDialog) when needed, providing the appropriate payload values.

Example usage:


```jsx
import { setCurrentPage, setIsOpenDialog } from './path/to/getScrollPageSlice';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

// Inside a component
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// Dispatching the actions
dispatch(setCurrentPage(2));
dispatch(setIsOpenDialog(true));

// Accessing the state
const currentPage = useSelector(state => state.getScrollPage.currentPage);
const isOpenDialog = useSelector(state => state.getScrollPage.isOpenDialog);


```


## Additional Information
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before using this code. This code is intended to be used in a Redux-based application for managing data list values. Refer to the Redux documentation for more details on incorporating this slice into your Redux store.

Feel free to modify the initial state, actions, and reducer based on your specific requirements.

Note: Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.
