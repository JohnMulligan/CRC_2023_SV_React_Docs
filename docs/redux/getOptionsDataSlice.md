# Redux Store: getOptionsDataSlice

### Slice Configuration
```getOptionsDataSlice```: The getOptionsData data includes information about different filter objects, such as the variable name, type, label, and flatable. This data is used throughout the app in various filter objects.


```getOptionsDataSlice```: The getOptionsDataSlice is configured using the createSlice function from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It defines the following properties:
- `name`: The name of the slice is set to "optionsData".
- `initialState`: The initial state of the slice includes empty object;

`Actions`
The getOptionsDataSlice slice defines the following actions:

- `getOptions`: Accepts a payload and updates the initialState property in the state with the provided value.

To use these actions, import them from `getOptions` and dispatch them as needed to modify the state.

``Reducer``

The reducer function for getOptionsDataSlice is automatically generated by the createSlice function. It handles state updates based on the dispatched actions and returns the updated state.

## Usage
To use the getOptionsDataSlice in other parts of the application, follow these steps:

1) Import the necessary actions and the reducer function from getScrollPageSlice.
2) Dispatch the actions (getOptionsFlatMenu) when needed, providing the appropriate payload values.

Example usage:


```jsx
import { getOptions} from './path/to/getOptionsDataSlice';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

// Inside a component
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// Dispatching the actions
dispatch(getOptions({...value}));

// Accessing the state
const menuOptionFlat: VoyagaesFilterMenu = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.getOptions.value);


```
