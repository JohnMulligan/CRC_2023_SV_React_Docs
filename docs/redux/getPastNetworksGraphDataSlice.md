# getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice
## Overview
The provided code defines a Redux slice named `getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice`. This slice is responsible for managing the state related to past network data, including node and edge information, modal state, network ID, and network key.

## Dependencies
Redux Toolkit: This code utilizes Redux Toolkit, a library that simplifies the setup of Redux store and actions.

## Initial State
The initial state of the `getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice` is defined as an object with the following properties:
- `data:` An object with `nodes` and `edges` properties, representing node and edge data for the past network.
- `openModal`: A boolean indicating whether a modal is open or closed.
- `networkID:` A number representing the network ID.
-  `networkKEY:` A string representing the network key.

## Reducer Name: `pastNetworks`
The `getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice` contains the following reducers:

### Reducers
1) #### setPastNetworksData
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<Datas>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `data` property in the state to the `Datas` object provided in the action payload, containing node and edge data.

2) #### setsetOpenModalNetworks
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<boolean>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `openModal` property in the state to the boolean value provided in the action payload, indicating whether the modal is open or closed.

3) #### setNetWorksID
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `networkID` property in the state to the number value provided in the action payload, representing the network ID.

4) #### setNetWorksKEY
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `networkKEY` property in the state to the string value provided in the action payload, representing the network key.

## Action Creators
The action creators for the reducers mentioned above are automatically generated by Redux Toolkit, making it easy to dispatch these actions.

## Usage
This Redux slice is designed to be used within a Redux store in a React application to manage past network data. Developers can dispatch the defined actions to update the state with new network data, modal state, network ID, or network key.

## Example Dispatch
```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { setPastNetworksData } from './getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice';

// Dispatching the setPastNetworksData action with new network data
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(setPastNetworksData({ nodes: [...newNodes], edges: [...newEdges] }));
```

## Export
The `getPastNetworksGraphDataSlice` reducer and its associated action creators are exported for use in other parts of the Redux store setup and application components.
## Additional Information
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before using this code. This code is intended to be used in a Redux-based application for managing networks data list values. Refer to the Redux documentation for more details on incorporating this slice into your Redux store.

Feel free to modify the initial state, actions, and reducer based on your specific requirements.

Note: Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.
