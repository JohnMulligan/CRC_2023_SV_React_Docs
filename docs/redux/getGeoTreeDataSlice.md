# getGeoTreeDataSlice

## Overview
The provided code defines a Redux slice named `getGeoTreeDataSlice`. This slice is responsible for managing the state related to geo tree data, including lists of tree items, selected values, and a flag indicating changes to the geo tree.

## Dependencies
- Redux Toolkit: This code utilizes Redux Toolkit, a library that simplifies the setup of Redux store and actions.

## Initial State
The initial state of the `getGeoTreeDataSlice` is defined as an object with the following properties:

- `geoTreeList:` An array representing a list of geo tree items.
- `geoTreeValue:` An object that may contain tree item data or string values.
- `geoTreeSelectValue:` An array of string values representing selected tree items.
- `isChangeGeoTree:` A boolean flag indicating whether there has been a change to the geo tree.


## Reducer Name: getGeoTreeBoxSlice
The `getGeoTreeDataSlice` contains the following reducers:


## Reducers
1) #### setGeoTreeValueList
- Action: `(state, action) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `geoTreeList` property in the state to the value provided in the action.

2) #### setGeoTreeValues
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<Record<string, TreeSelectItem[] | string[]>>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `geoTreeValue` property in the state to the value provided in the action.

3) #### setGeoTreeValueSelect
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<string[]>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `geoTreeSelectValue` property in the state to the array of string values provided in the action.

4) #### setIsChangeGeoTree
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<boolean>) => {}`
- Description: Sets the `isChangeGeoTree` flag in the state to the boolean value provided in the action.

5) #### resetSlice
- Action: `(state) => {}`
- Description: Resets the state to its initial state, clearing all data.
## Action Creators
The action creators for the reducers mentioned above are automatically generated by Redux Toolkit, making it easy to dispatch these actions.

## Usage
This Redux slice is designed to be used within a Redux store in a React application to manage geo tree data. Developers can dispatch the defined actions to update the state with new geo tree data, selected values, or to indicate changes to the geo tree.

## Example Dispatch
```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { setGeoTreeValueList } from './getGeoTreeDataSlice';

// Dispatching the setGeoTreeValueList action with new tree data
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(setGeoTreeValueList([...newTreeData]));
```
## Export
- The `getGeoTreeDataSlice` reducer and its associated action creators are exported for use in other parts of the Redux store setup and application components.
## Additional Information
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before using this code. This code is intended to be used in a Redux-based application for managing geo tree data list values. Refer to the Redux documentation for more details on incorporating this slice into your Redux store.

Feel free to modify the initial state, actions, and reducer based on your specific requirements.

Note: Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.
