# getDataPathNameSlice

## Overview
The provided code defines a Redux slice named `getDataPathNameSlice`. This slice is responsible for managing the state related to a data path name. It includes a property to store the path name as a string.

## Dependencies
- Redux Toolkit: This code utilizes Redux Toolkit, a library that simplifies the setup of Redux store and actions.

## Initial State
The initial state of the `getDataPathNameSlice` is defined as an object with the following property:
- `pathName:` A string representing the data path name.

## Reducer Name: getDataPathName
The `getDataPathNameSlice` contains one reducer:

## Reducer
1)  #### setPathName
- Action: `(state, action: PayloadAction<string>)`
- Description: Sets the `pathName` property in the state to the string value provided in the action payload.

## Action Creator
The action creator for the `setPathName` reducer is automatically generated by Redux Toolkit, making it easy to dispatch this action.

## Usage
This Redux slice is designed to be used within a Redux store in a React application to manage the data path name. Developers can dispatch the `setPathName` action to update the state with a new data path name.

## Example Dispatch
```jsx
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { setPathName } from './getDataPathNameSlice';

// Dispatching the setPathName action with a new path name
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(setPathName('/data/example'));

```

## Export
- The `getDataPathNameSlice` reducer and its associated action creator are exported for use in other parts of the Redux store setup and application components.

## Additional Information
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed and properly configured before using this code. This code is intended to be used in a Redux-based application for managing path name data values. Refer to the Redux documentation for more details on incorporating this slice into your Redux store.

Feel free to modify the initial state, actions, and reducer based on your specific requirements.

Note: Make sure to adjust the import paths according to your project structure.
