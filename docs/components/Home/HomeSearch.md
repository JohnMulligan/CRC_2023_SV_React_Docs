# HomeSearch Component
The `HomeSearch` component is a React component that represents the homepage of an application. It provides a user-friendly interface for navigating to different sections of the application, with a focus on voyages, people, documents, and writing resources.

## Prerequisites
Before using this component, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- React: ^16.8.0 or higher
- React Router: ^5.0.0 or higher (for navigation)
- Redux: ^4.0.0 or higher (for state management)

## Installation
You can use this component in your React application by importing it as follows:

```jsx
import HomeSearch from './HomeSearch'; // Replace with the actual path to the component file
```

## Usage
To use the `HomeSearch` component in your application, follow these steps:

- Import the component as mentioned above.
- Render the component within your JSX/TSX code:
```jsx
<HomeSearch />
```

1) The component provides the following functionality:
    - Quick links to different sections of the application, such as voyages, people, documents, and writing resources.
    - Clicking on these links triggers navigation to the respective sections.
2) You can customize the appearance and behavior of each link by modifying the component's code. The links are associated with specific routes defined in your application using React Router.

## Example
Here's a basic example of how to use the `HomeSearch` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import HomeSearch from './HomeSearch';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Our Application</h1>
      <HomeSearch />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of each section link by modifying the component's code. Each link corresponds to a specific route within your application, so make sure your routes are set up correctly using React Router.

## Note: 
Make sure to replace the placeholder paths and adapt the component to your project's specific requirements. This README assumes you are familiar with React, React Router, and Redux.
