# BurgerMenu Component
The `BurgerMenu` component is a React functional component that represents a burger menu icon. It utilizes the `StyledBurger` component from the stylesMenu/StyledBurger module.

## Props
The `BurgerMenu` component accepts the following props:

- `open` (boolean): Indicates whether the burger menu is currently open or closed.
- `setOpen` (React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>): A state setter function to update the value of the `open` prop.

## Usage
To use the `BurgerMenu` component, follow these steps:

- Import the `StyledBurger` component from the `stylesMenu/StyledBurger` module:

```jsx
import { StyledBurger } from './stylesMenu/StyledBurger';
```
- Define the interface for the `BurgerMenu` component props:

```jsx
interface BurgerMenuProps {
  open: boolean;
  setOpen: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>;
}
```
The `BurgerMenuProps` interface specifies that the `BurgerMenu` component expects two props: `open` of type boolean to represent the open/closed state, and `setOpen` of type `React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<boolean>>` to update the open state.

- Implement the BurgerMenu component:

```jsx
export const BurgerMenu: React.FC<BurgerMenuProps> = ({ open, setOpen }) => {
  return (
    <StyledBurger open={open} onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
      <div />
      <div />
      <div />
    </StyledBurger>
  );
};

```

The `BurgerMenu` component is a functional component that receives the `open` and `setOpen` props. It renders the `StyledBurger` component and passes the open prop to it.

When the burger menu icon is clicked, the `onClick` event handler is triggered, and it calls the `setOpen` function with the opposite value of `open`. This toggles the state between open and closed.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the `BurgerMenu` component in a parent component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { BurgerMenu } from './BurgerMenu';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <BurgerMenu open={open} setOpen={setOpen} />
      {/* Add other components or content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

```

In this example, the `BurgerMenu` component is used within the `MyComponent` parent component. The `open` state and `setOpen` state setter function are initialized using the `useState` hook.

The `BurgerMenu` component is rendered with the `open` prop set to the open state and the `setOpen` prop set to the `setOpen` function. This allows the `BurgerMenu` component to control the open/closed state of the burger menu icon.

By clicking on the burger menu icon, the state is updated, and the icon's appearance can be changed accordingly, enabling further actions or rendering menu-related components as needed.
