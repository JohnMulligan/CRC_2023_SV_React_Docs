## VideoBackground Component

The `VideoBackground` component is a React component that displays a video as a background element on a web page. It creates an immersive visual experience for users by showing a looping and muted video. This can be used to enhance the aesthetics and engagement of your website or application.

## Prerequisites
Before using this component, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- React: ^16.8.0 or higher (or compatible version)

## Installation
You can use this component in your React application by importing it as follows:

```jsx
import VideoBackground from './VideoBackground'; // Replace with the actual path to the component file

```

## Usage
To use the `VideoBackground` component in your application, follow these steps:

1) Import the component as mentioned above.
2) Render the component within your JSX/TSX code:

```jsx
<VideoBackground />
```

1) The component provides the following functionality:
    - Displays a video (BackGroundVideo) as the background of a designated container (video-background).
    - The video starts playing automatically (autoPlay).
    - The video is muted to avoid playing audio by default (muted).
    - The video loops continuously (loop).
2) You can customize the video by replacing the BackGroundVideo video source with your own video file. Ensure that the video format specified in the type attribute (video/mp4) matches the format of your video file.

## Example
Here's a basic example of how to use the `VideoBackground` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import VideoBackground from './VideoBackground';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <VideoBackground />
      {/* Other content of your application */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `VideoBackground` component by modifying the component's code. You can also adjust the styling of the video-background container to control the video's position, size, and other visual properties.

## Note: 
Make sure to replace the placeholder `BackGroundVideo` with the path to your own video file, and adapt the component to your project's specific requirements. This README assumes you are familiar with React.
