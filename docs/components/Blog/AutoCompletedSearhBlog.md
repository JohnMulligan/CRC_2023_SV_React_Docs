The `AutoCompletedSearhBlog` component is a React component that provides an autocomplete search functionality for a blog-related application. This component is designed to be used within a larger application and interacts with Redux state, MUI (Material-UI) components, and routing through React Router.


## Prerequisites

- React (>= 16.8)
- Redux (with React Redux)
- Material-UI (MUI)
- React Router
- lodash.debounce

## Installation
You can include the `AutoCompletedSearhBlog component in your React project by importing it as follows:`

```jsx
import AutoCompletedSearhBlog from './AutoCompletedSearhBlog'; // Adjust the import path accordingly
```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the `AutoCompletedSearhBlog` component in your React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import AutoCompletedSearhBlog from './AutoCompletedSearhBlog'; // Adjust the import path accordingly

function App() {
  return (

## Props

The `AutoCompletedSearhBlog` component does not accept any props from its parent component. However, it relies on Redux state and actions, so you should ensure that Redux is correctly configured in your project.

## Example
In this example, the `AutoCompletedSearhBlog` component is used within a larger React application to provide blog search functionality. It interacts with Redux state, dispatches actions, and uses Material-UI for the autocomplete input.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './redux/rootReducer';
import AutoCompletedSearhBlog from './AutoCompletedSearhBlog';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  // Additional Redux store configuration options if needed
});

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Router>
        <div className="App">
          <header>
            {/* Your application header */}
          </header>
          <main>
            <AutoCompletedSearhBlog />
            {/* Other components and content */}
          </main>
          <footer>
            {/* Your application footer */}
          </footer>
        </div>
      </Router>
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Please note that you should customize this example to fit your specific project structure and requirements. Ensure that you have the required dependencies and Redux store properly configured for the `AutoCompletedSearhBlog` component to work correctly.
