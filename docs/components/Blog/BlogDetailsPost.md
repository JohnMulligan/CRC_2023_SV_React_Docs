# BlogDetailsPost


## Introduction
`BlogDetailsPost` is a React functional component that represents the structure of a blog post detail page. It includes various components responsible for rendering the header, navigation bar, and content of a blog post. This component is typically used as a template for displaying the details of a specific blog post within your React application.


## Installation

To use the `BlogDetailsPost` component, you need to ensure that your React project is set up correctly and that you have the required dependencies and components installed. Here are the steps to include this component in your project:

1) Import the necessary dependencies and components at the beginning of your file:

```jsx
import HeaderLogoSearch from '../header/HeaderSearchLogo';
import NavBlog from './NavBarBlog';
import BlogCardHeaderBody from './BlogCardHeaderBody';
import '@/style/blogs.scss';
import { Divider } from '@mui/material';
import BlogCardContent from './BlogCardContent';

```
1) Create a functional component named `BlogDetailsPost`.


```jsx
const BlogDetailsPost: React.FC = () => {
  // ...
  // Component structure and logic go here
  // ...
};

```
1) Implement the component structure by arranging the imported components and adding any necessary JSX markup.

2) Return the JSX that represents the structure of the blog post detail page.

3) Export the `BlogDetailsPost` component as the default export of your module.

## Usage
To use the `BlogDetailsPost` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Import the `BlogDetailsPost` component into the file where you want to display the details of a specific blog post.

```jsx
import BlogDetailsPost from './BlogDetailsPost'; // Adjust the import path as needed
 
```

1) Place the `BlogDetailsPost` component within your JSX to render the structure of the blog post detail page.

```jsx 
<BlogDetailsPost />
```

1) Ensure that you have set up your project's routing and data fetching mechanisms to display the appropriate blog post details when this component is rendered.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the `BlogDetailsPost` component within a React application:


```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import BlogDetailsPost from './BlogDetailsPost'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/blog/:postId">
            <BlogDetailsPost />
            {/* Add additional components and routes as needed */}
          </Route>
          {/* Add other routes as needed */}
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;


```

In this example, the `BlogDetailsPost` component is used within a route that matches a blog post's ID in the URL. You should adapt this example to fit your application's routing structure and data fetching mechanisms.
