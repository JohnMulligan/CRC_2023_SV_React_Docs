# InstitutionAuthorsList Component

## Getting Started
To use the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have a React project set up.

2) Import the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component into your application where you want to display a list of authors associated with an institution.

3) Use the `<InstitutionAuthorsList />` component in your application as needed.

## Dependencies
The InstitutionAuthorsList component relies on several dependencies:

- React `(and React DOM)`
- Redux `(react-redux)`
- `RootState` from `redux/store`
- `InitialStateBlogProps` from `share/InterfaceTypesBlog`
- Constants and utility functions from various locations in the project

Make sure these dependencies are installed in your project before using the component.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component in a React application:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import InstitutionAuthorsList from './InstitutionAuthorsList'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function InstitutionAuthors() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <InstitutionAuthorsList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
This code imports the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component and renders it in the application.

## Component Structure
The InstitutionAuthorsList component is structured as follows:

- It imports necessary dependencies, styles, and assets at the beginning of the file.

- The component retrieves a list of authors associated with an institution from the Redux store using the `useSelector` hook.

- It maps through the list of authors and generates HTML elements to display them.

- Each author is displayed as a media element with their photo, name, role, and a link to their author page.

## Props
The `InstitutionAuthorsList` component does not accept any props directly. Instead, it relies on Redux state to retrieve the list of authors associated with an institution.

## How It Works
1) The `InstitutionAuthorsList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to retrieve a list of authors associated with an institution from the Redux store.

2) It checks if the institutionList has any elements. If it does, it maps through the list and generates HTML elements for each author.

3) Each author is displayed as a media element with their photo, name, role, and a link to their author page. The photo is displayed as a rounded circle, and clicking on the author's name or photo navigates to their respective author page.

4) The list of authors is displayed within a container, and each author's information is displayed in a separate media element.
