# InstitutionAuthors Component

This README provides an overview of the `InstitutionAuthors` React component. 
The `InstitutionAuthors` component is responsible for displaying information about an institution, including its name, description, and a list of authors associated with the institution.

## Getting Started
To use the `InstitutionAuthors` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have a React project set up.

2) Import the `InstitutionAuthors` component into your application where you want to display information about an institution and its authors.

3) Use the `<InstitutionAuthors />` component in your application as needed.

## Dependencies

The `InstitutionAuthors` component relies on several dependencies:

- React (and React DOM)
- Redux `(react-redux)`
- Material-UI `(@mui/material)`
- `RootState` and `AppDispatch` from `redux/store`
- `InitialStateBlogProps` from `share/InterfaceTypesBlog`
- Constants and utility functions from various locations in the project

Make sure these dependencies are installed in your project before using the component.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `InstitutionAuthors` component in a React application:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import InstitutionAuthors from './InstitutionAuthors'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function InstitutionAuthorsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <InstitutionAuthors />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

This code imports the `InstitutionAuthors` component and renders it in the application.

## Component Structure
The `InstitutionAuthors` component is structured as follows:

- It imports necessary dependencies, styles, and assets at the beginning of the file.

- The component retrieves institution data and the associated authors' list using the `useSelector` hook from Redux.

- It displays the institution's name, description, and an image.

- The component also renders a list of authors associated with the institution using the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component.


## Props
The `InstitutionAuthors` component does not accept any props directly. Instead, it relies on Redux state to retrieve institution data.


## How It Works
1) The `InstitutionAuthors` component uses the `useSelector` hook to retrieve institution data from the Redux store.

2) It also retrieves the institution's ID from the URL parameters using the `useParams` hook.

3) The component then fetches institution data by dispatching an action that calls the `fetchInstitutionDataAPI` function. It passes the institution's ID as a parameter to this function.

4) Once the data is fetched, it updates the Redux state with the institution's data and the list of authors associated with it.

5) The component displays the institution's name, description, and an image. If the image is available, it's displayed; otherwise, a placeholder image `(IMGMOCK)` is used.

6) A list of authors associated with the institution is displayed below the institution's information. This list is generated by the `InstitutionAuthorsList` component.
