# SelectBlogDropdown

## Introduction
`SelectBlogDropdown` is a React component designed to create a dropdown menu that allows users to select search options related to blog posts. This component provides a button that, when clicked, opens a menu containing a list of search options. Users can select an option from the menu to perform a specific search action. This README documentation explains the purpose of the component and provides guidance on how to use it within your React application.

## Installation
To use the `SelectBlogDropdown` component, you need to ensure that your React project is set up correctly and that you have the required dependencies installed. Here are the steps to include this component in your project:

1) Import the necessary dependencies and components at the beginning of your file:

```jsx
import { useState, MouseEvent, useCallback } from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import Menu from '@mui/material/Menu';
import MenuItem from '@mui/material/MenuItem';
import Fade from '@mui/material/Fade';
import { ArrowDropDown, Link } from '@mui/icons-material';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { RootState } from '@/redux/store';
import { setSearchAutoKey, setSearchBlogTitle } from '@/redux/getBlogDataSlice';
import { SearchBlogData } from '@/share/InterfaceTypesBlog';
import { BLOGPAGE } from '@/share/CONST_DATA';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

```

1) Create an interface named `SelectBlogDropdownProps` to define the props required by the `SelectBlogDropdown` component. In this case, it includes a handleReset function to reset any existing search criteria.

```jsx
interface SelectBlogDropdownProps {
  handleReset: () => void;
}
```

1) Create the `SelectBlogDropdown` component using the defined props.

```jsx
export default function SelectBlogDropdown({
  handleReset,
}: SelectBlogDropdownProps) {
  // ...
  // Component structure and logic go here
  // ...
}

```

1) Implement the component structure by arranging the JSX markup and adding the necessary logic to handle the dropdown menu and user selections.

2) Return the JSX that represents the dropdown menu and button.

3) Export the `SelectBlogDropdown` component as the default export of your module.

## Usage
To use the `SelectBlogDropdown` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Import the `SelectBlogDropdown` component into the file where you want to display the dropdown menu for selecting search options.


```jsx
import SelectBlogDropdown from './SelectBlogDropdown'; // Adjust the import path as needed

```
1) Place the `SelectBlogDropdown` component within your JSX to render the dropdown menu and button.

```jsx
<SelectBlogDropdown handleReset={handleReset} />
```

1) Ensure that you have set up the necessary state, data, and event handlers in your component to work with the `SelectBlogDropdown` component. The handleReset function can be used to reset any existing search criteria when the user selects an option.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the `SelectBlogDropdown` component within a React application:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import SelectBlogDropdown from './SelectBlogDropdown'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function BlogSearch() {
  // Initialize state and data for blog search
  const [searchCriteria, setSearchCriteria] = useState('');
  const handleReset = () => {
    // Implement logic to reset search criteria
    setSearchCriteria('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render other search components */}
      {/* ... */}
      {/* Render the SelectBlogDropdown component */}
      <SelectBlogDropdown handleReset={handleReset} />
      {/* Implement search functionality using searchCriteria */}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogSearch;

```

In this example, the `SelectBlogDropdown` component is used within a component that handles blog post searching. Ensure that you provide the appropriate event handlers and state to the component to handle user selections and search criteria.
