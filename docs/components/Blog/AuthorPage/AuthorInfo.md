# AuthorInfo Component

This README provides an overview of the `AuthorInfo` React component. The `AuthorInfo` component is responsible for displaying information about an author, including their name, role, institution, and a list of their blog posts.


## Getting Started
To use the `AuthorInfo` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have a React project set up.

2) Import the `AuthorInfo` component into your application where you want to display author information.

3) Use the `<AuthorInfo />` component in your application as needed.

## Dependencies

The `AuthorInfo` component relies on several dependencies:

- React `(and React DOM)`
- Material-UI `(@mui/material)`
- React Router `(react-router-dom)`
- Redux `(react-redux)`
- `fetchAuthorData` from `blogApi/fetchAuthorData`
- `InitialStateBlogProps` from `share/InterfaceTypesBlog`
- `AuthorPostList` component
Constants and utility functions from various locations in the project
Make sure these dependencies are installed in your project before using the component.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `AuthorInfo` component in a React application:

```jsx 
import React from 'react';
import AuthorInfo from './AuthorInfo'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <AuthorInfo />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code imports the `AuthorInfo` component and renders it in the application.


## Component Structure
The `AuthorInfo` component is structured as follows:

- It imports necessary dependencies and styles at the beginning of the file.

- The component retrieves author data using the `useParams` hook and dispatches actions using `useDispatch` from Redux.

- uthor information is displayed, including name, role, institution, and a photo.

- The author's description is also displayed if available.

- A list of the author's blog posts is displayed using the `AuthorPostList` component.

## Props
The `AuthorInfo` component does not accept any props directly. Instead, it relies on Redux state and the `useParams` hook to retrieve author data and ID.

## How It Works
1) The `AuthorInfo` component uses the `useParams` hook to extract the author's ID from the URL.

2) It dispatches an action to fetch author data using the `fetchAuthorData` function. This data includes the author's information and their blog posts.

3) Once the data is retrieved, it updates the Redux state using the `setAuthorData` and `setAuthorPost` actions.

4) The component then displays the author's information, including their name, role, institution, and photo.

5) If available, the author's description is displayed.

6) A link to the author's institution is provided with a URL generated based on the institution's name and ID.

7) A list of the author's blog posts is displayed below the author's information.
