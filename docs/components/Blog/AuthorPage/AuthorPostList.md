# AuthorPostList Component

This README provides an overview of the `AuthorPostList` React component. The `AuthorPostList` component is responsible for displaying a list of blog posts written by an author.

## Getting Started
To use the `AuthorPostList` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have a React project set up.

2) Import the `AuthorPostList` component into your application where you want to display a list of author's blog posts.

3) Use the `<AuthorPostList />` component in your application as needed.

## Dependencies
The AuthorPostList component relies on several dependencies:

- React `(and React DOM)`
- Redux `(react-redux)`
- RootState from `redux/store`
- `InitialStateBlogProps` from `share/InterfaceTypesBlog`
- Constants and utility functions from various locations in the project

Make sure these dependencies are installed in your project before using the component.

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `AuthorPostList` component in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import AuthorPostList from './AuthorPostList'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <AuthorPostList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
This code imports the `AuthorPostList` component and renders it in the application.

## Component Structure
The `AuthorPostList` component is structured as follows:

- It imports necessary dependencies, styles, and utility functions at the beginning of the file.

- The component retrieves author post data and language preferences using the `useSelector` hook from Redux.

- It maps through the list of author's blog posts and generates HTML elements to display them.

- Each blog post is displayed as a card with a title, subtitle, and thumbnail image. Clicking on a blog post card will navigate to the full blog post.


## Props
The `AuthorPostList` component does not accept any props directly. Instead, it relies on Redux state to retrieve the list of author's blog posts and language preferences.

## How It Works
1) The `AuthorPostList` component uses the `useSelector` hook to retrieve the list of author's blog posts from the Redux store.

2) It also retrieves the selected language from the Redux store.

3) The component then maps through the list of author's blog posts, generating HTML elements for each post.

4) Each blog post is displayed as a card with its title, subtitle, and thumbnail image. If the post's language matches the selected language, the thumbnail is displayed; otherwise, it's hidden.

5) Clicking on a blog post card navigates the user to the full blog post using React Router's `Link` component.

6) The list of blog post cards is displayed in columns within a container.
