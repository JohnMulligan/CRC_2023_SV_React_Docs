# DatasetButton Component 
The `DatasetButton` component is a React functional component designed to render buttons representing datasets or collections. These buttons are used to select and filter data based on the chosen dataset. The component provides customization options for button appearance and handles user interactions.

## Prerequisites
Before using the `DatasetButton` component, ensure that you have the following dependencies and prerequisites installed:

- React: The component is designed for use within a React application.
- Material-UI: This component utilizes Material-UI's `Button` component for rendering the dataset buttons.
- Various utility functions and assets: The component relies on utility functions and assets imported from various locations in your project.

## Installation
To use the `DatasetButton` component, you can import it directly into your React application. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project.

```jsx
import { DatasetButton } from './DatasetButton'; // Adjust the import path as needed

```
## Usage
The `DatasetButton` component is typically used within a parent component, such as a filter panel or dataset selection interface. Here's an example of how to use it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BaseFilter } from '@/share/InterfactTypesDatasetCollection';
import { getColorBoxShadow, getColorBTNBackground, getColorHover } from './utils'; // Import utility functions
import { DatasetButton } from './DatasetButton'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function DatasetSelectionPanel() {
  const baseFilter: BaseFilter[] = []; // Define your base filter data
  const textHeader = 'Dataset Header';
  const textIntro = 'Dataset Introduction';

  const handleSelectDataset = (
    baseFilter: BaseFilter[],
    textHeader: string,
    textIntro: string,
    styleName: string,
    blocks: string[],
    filterMenuFlatfile?: string,
    tableFlatfile?: string
  ) => {
    // Handle dataset selection and apply filters
    // You can customize this function based on your application's requirements
  };

  return (
    <div className="DatasetSelectionPanel">
      {/* Render dataset buttons */}
      {datasetItems.map((item, index) => (
        <DatasetButton
          key={`${item}-${index}`}
          item={item}
          index={index}
          handleSelectDataset={handleSelectDataset}
          getColorBoxShadow={getColorBoxShadow}
          getColorBTNBackground={getColorBTNBackground}
          getColorHover={getColorHover}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default DatasetSelectionPanel;

```

In the example above, the `DatasetButton` component is used to render dataset selection buttons within a `DatasetSelectionPanel` component. The `handleSelectDataset` function is called when a button is clicked to handle dataset selection and filtering.

## Component Features
## Props
The `DatasetButton` component accepts the following props:

- `getColorBoxShadow:` A function that returns the box shadow style for the button based on the dataset's style.
- `item:` An object representing the dataset item with properties like `base_filter`, `headers`, `style_name`, `blocks`, `table_flatfile`, and `filter_menu_flatfile`.
- `index:` The index of the dataset item.
- `handleSelectDataset:` A function to handle dataset selection and filtering. It takes various parameters like `baseFilter`, `textHeader`, `textIntro`, `styleName`, `blocks`, `filterMenuFlatfile`, and `tableFlatfile`.
- `getColorBTNBackground:` A function that returns the background color for the button based on the dataset's style.
- `getColorHover:` A function that returns the hover background color for the button based on the dataset's style.

## Functionality
The `DatasetButton` component provides the following functionality:

- Rendering dataset selection buttons with customizable styles.
- Handling dataset selection and filtering based on user interactions.

## Styling
The component utilizes Material-UI's `Button` component for rendering buttons. It allows customization of button styles, including text color, background color, font size, and more, based on the dataset's style.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the `DatasetButton` component by passing different props and styles when using it within your application. Additionally, you can adjust the `handleSelectDataset` function to implement dataset-specific filtering logic.
