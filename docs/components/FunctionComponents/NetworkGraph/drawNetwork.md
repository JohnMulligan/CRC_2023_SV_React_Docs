# drawNetwork Function Documentation
The `drawNetwork` function is a JavaScript function responsible for rendering a network diagram on an HTML5 Canvas element. It accepts various parameters, including canvas context, dimensions, node and edge data, transformations, and additional options. This documentation provides an overview of the function, its purpose, and usage.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `drawNetwork` function is to visualize a network diagram by drawing nodes and edges on an HTML5 Canvas element. It is commonly used in applications that require the display of interconnected elements, such as graphs, social networks, or data visualizations.

## Parameters
The `drawNetwork` function takes the following parameters:

- `context` (CanvasRenderingContext2D): The Canvas 2D rendering context on which the network diagram will be drawn.

- `width` (number): The width of the canvas in pixels.

- `height` (number): The height of the canvas in pixels.

- `nodes` (Nodes[]): An array of node objects representing the network's nodes.

- `edges` (Edges[]): An array of edge objects representing the network's edges.

- `newNode` (any | Nodes | null): An optional parameter representing a new node to be highlighted or labeled differently.

- `transform` (d3.ZoomTransform): A transformation object that can be applied to the canvas context to support zooming and panning functionality.

## Rendering Logic
The function performs the following rendering logic:

1) `Canvas Clearing:` It clears the canvas by erasing any previously drawn content using `context.clearRect.`

2) `Zoom Transformation:` It applies the zoom transformation to the canvas context using `context.translate` and `context.scale.` This allows the network to be zoomed in or out and panned across the canvas.

3) `Drawing Edges:` It iterates through the `edges` array and draws the edges connecting nodes. It sets the edge's color based on a stroke color calculation.

4) `Drawing Nodes:` It iterates through the `nodes` array and draws each node as a circle. The node's color is determined based on its class. Labels and additional styling are applied to nodes, such as text labels and hover effects.

## Dependencies
The `drawNetwork` function relies on various constants and utility functions from external modules and files. These dependencies include constants like `RADIUSNODE`, `classToColor`, and utility functions such as `createSrokeColor`, `createdLableEdges`, `createdLableNode`, and `createdLableNodeHover`. Ensure that these dependencies are available and correctly configured in your project.

## Usage
To use the `drawNetwork` function, you typically follow these steps:

1) Create an HTML5 Canvas element in your web application where you want to display the network diagram.

2) Obtain a 2D rendering context from the canvas element using `canvas.getContext('2d').`

3) Call the `drawNetwork` function, passing the canvas context, canvas dimensions, node and edge data, transformation, and any additional parameters.

4) Ensure that the network data (`nodes` and `edges`) is correctly prepared and structured to match the function's expectations.

5) Optionally, use CSS to style the Canvas element and its surrounding container.


Please make sure to integrate and adapt this function into your project according to your specific use case and requirements.
