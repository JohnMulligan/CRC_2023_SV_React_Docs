# findNode Function Documentation

The `findNode` function is a JavaScript utility function designed to identify and retrieve information about a node (element) in a network diagram that is currently located within a specified proximity to a given point. This function is commonly used in applications that visualize network data, such as graphs, social networks, or data visualizations. This documentation provides an overview of the function, its purpose, and usage.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `findNode` function is to determine whether a node in a network diagram is located within a certain radius around a specified point (x, y coordinates). If a node is found within the defined proximity, the function returns information about that node. This functionality is valuable for enabling interactive features like selecting nodes or displaying additional information when users interact with network diagrams.

## Parameters
The `findNode` function takes the following parameters:

- `nodes (Nodes[]):` An array of node objects representing the nodes in the network diagram.

- `x (number):` The x-coordinate (horizontal position) of the specified point.

- `y (number):` The y-coordinate (vertical position) of the specified point.

- `radius` (number): The radius (distance) within which to search for nodes around the specified point.

## Node Identification
The function performs the following steps to identify the node within the specified radius:

1) `Reverse Iteration:` It iterates through the array of `nodes` representing the nodes in the network diagram in reverse order. Reverse iteration is used to prioritize nodes that appear on top of others when they overlap.

2) `Node Position Check:` For each node in the array, it checks whether the node has defined x and y coordinates (`node.x` and `node.y`). If the node lacks these coordinates, it skips the node.

3) `Distance Calculation:` It calculates the squared Euclidean distance `(distSq)` between the specified point `(x, y)` and the center of the node. The squared distance is used for efficiency, as it avoids the need for square root calculations.

4) `Proximity Check:` It compares the squared distance `(distSq)` with the squared radius `(rSq)`. If the squared distance is less than the squared radius, it indicates that the node is within the specified proximity, and the function returns the node.

5) `Returning the Node:` If a node is found within the specified radius, the function returns the node object. If no node is found within the radius, it returns `undefined` to indicate that no node is currently within the proximity.

## Usage
To use the `findNode` function, you typically follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have an array of `nodes` representing the nodes in the network diagram and that these nodes are correctly structured with `x` and `y` coordinates (if available).

2) Capture the coordinates `(x, y)` of the point around which you want to search for nodes.

3) Define the radius `(radius)` within which to search for nodes.

4) Call the `findNode` function, passing the `nodes`, `x`, `y`, and `radius` as parameters.

5) Check the returned value:

    - If the function returns a node object, you have identified a node within the specified proximity.
    - If the function returns `undefined`, no node is currently within the proximity.

## Example

```jsx
// Example usage of the findNode function
const x = 100; // X-coordinate of the specified point
const y = 200; // Y-coordinate of the specified point
const searchRadius = 10; // Radius within which to search for nodes

const foundNode = findNode(nodesArray, x, y, searchRadius);

if (foundNode !== undefined) {
  // Handle the found node (e.g., select or display additional information)
  console.log('Found Node:', foundNode);
} else {
  // No node is currently within the specified proximity
  console.log('No Node Found');
}
```
## How to Created function findNode
```jsx
import { Nodes } from "@/share/InterfaceTypePastNetworks";

export function findNode(nodes: Nodes[], x: number, y: number, radius: number) {
    const rSq = radius * radius;
    for (let i = nodes?.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        const node = nodes[i];
        if (node.x && node.y) {
            const dx = x - node.x,
                dy = y - node.y,
                distSq = dx * dx + dy * dy;
            if (distSq < rSq) {
                return node;
            }
        }
    }
    return undefined;
}
```
