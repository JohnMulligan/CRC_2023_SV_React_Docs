# findHoveredEdge Function Documentation
The findHoveredEdge function is a JavaScript function designed to identify and retrieve information about an edge (connection) in a network diagram that is currently being hovered over by the mouse cursor. This function is commonly used in applications that visualize network data, such as graphs, social networks, or data visualizations. This documentation provides an overview of the function, its purpose, and usage.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `findHoveredEdge` function is to determine whether the mouse cursor is positioned over any of the edges in a network diagram and, if so, to identify and return details about the specific edge that is being hovered over. This functionality is valuable for enabling interactive features like tooltips or additional information displays when users interact with network diagrams.

## Parameters
The `findHoveredEdge` function takes the following parameters:

- `edges (any[]):` An array of edge objects representing the connections between nodes in the network diagram.

- `nodes (Nodes[]):` An array of node objects representing the nodes in the network diagram.

- `mouseX (number):` The x-coordinate (horizontal position) of the mouse cursor on the canvas or screen.

- `mouseY (number):` The y-coordinate (vertical position) of the mouse cursor on the canvas or screen.

## Edge Identification
The function performs the following steps to identify the hovered edge:

1) `Iteration:` It iterates through the array of `edges` representing the connections between nodes in the network diagram.

2) `Node Retrieval:` For each edge, it retrieves the `source` and `target` nodes by matching the `uuid` property of the edge's `source` and `target` properties with the `uuid` property of nodes in the nodes array.

3) `Coordinates Comparison:` It determines the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the source and target nodes to define a bounding box around the edge.

4) `Mouse Cursor Position Check:` It checks whether the current mouse cursor position (`mouseX` and `mouseY`) falls within the bounding box of the edge. If the cursor is inside the bounding box, it considers the edge as the hovered edge and returns it.

5) `Returning the Hovered Edge:` If a hovered edge is found, the function returns the edge object. If no edge is found under the mouse cursor, it returns `null` to indicate that no edge is currently being hovered over.

## Usage
To use the `findHoveredEdge` function, you typically follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have an array of `edges` and an array of `nodes` representing the network diagram and that these arrays are correctly structured.

2) Capture mouse cursor coordinates, typically using event listeners like `mousemove`, and pass these coordinates as `mouseX` and `mouseY` to the function.

3) Call the `findHoveredEdge` function, passing the `edges`, `nodes`, and mouse cursor coordinates as parameters.

4) Check the returned value:

- If the function returns a non-null value, you have identified a hovered edge, and you can use its details for further actions (e.g., displaying a tooltip).
- If the function returns `null`, no edge is currently being hovered over.

## Example

```jsx
// Example usage of the findHoveredEdge function
import { Nodes } from '@/share/InterfaceTypePastNetworks';

export function findHoveredEdge(
  edges: any[],
  nodes: Nodes[],
  mouseX: number,
  mouseY: number
) {
  for (const edge of edges) {
    if (typeof edge.source !== 'string' && typeof edge.target !== 'string') {
      const sourceNode = nodes.find((node) => node.uuid === edge.source.uuid);
      const targetNode = nodes.find((node) => node.uuid === edge.target.uuid);

      if (sourceNode && targetNode) {
        const sourceX = typeof sourceNode.x === 'number' ? sourceNode.x : 0;
        const sourceY = typeof sourceNode.y === 'number' ? sourceNode.y : 0;
        const targetX = typeof targetNode.x === 'number' ? targetNode.x : 0;
        const targetY = typeof targetNode.y === 'number' ? targetNode.y : 0;

        const minX = Math.min(sourceX, targetX);
        const minY = Math.min(sourceY, targetY);
        const maxX = Math.max(sourceX, targetX);
        const maxY = Math.max(sourceY, targetY);

        if (
          mouseX >= minX &&
          mouseX <= maxX &&
          mouseY >= minY &&
          mouseY <= maxY
        ) {
          return edge;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return null; // No edge was found under the mouse
}
