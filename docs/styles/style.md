## Usage
These stylesheets play a crucial role in defining the visual design of the application. They are typically imported into React components or included in HTML templates to style various elements. You can use these styles as a reference when working on the application's user interface to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design.

Please note that modifying these styles should be done carefully to maintain the overall look and feel of the application and to ensure that styles are applied consistently across different parts of the project.
